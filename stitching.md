**1. Calling a GraphQL API Directly**
In this approach, the service (a Spring DGS service in this case) calls another GraphQL API directly from the resolver method to fetch the data it needs. This is similar to making a REST API call but uses a GraphQL API as the endpoint instead.

How it works: Your DGS service will use a GraphQL client to query an external GraphQL API whenever it needs to fetch data outside of its domain.
### Benefits:
  - Simplicity, since it’s a straightforward request/response pattern.
  - Fine-grained control over query structures and payload sizes.
  - Each service remains autonomous and independent.
### Drawbacks:
  - Each microservice has to be aware of and manage external GraphQL schemas.
  - Increased network calls, which may add latency and be less efficient at scale.
  - Handling authentication, batching, and error-handling can be more complex.
This is ideal for simple scenarios or when you need fine-grained control over calls to external services.

**2. Schema Stitching**
Schema stitching is a pattern where multiple GraphQL schemas are combined into a single schema, making it possible to resolve types and fields across microservices seamlessly. DGS doesn’t handle schema stitching directly, but you can implement similar behavior by using a schema that references multiple federated services.

How it works: Instead of calling external APIs directly, you define the relationships between entities (such as @key directives in federation) so that a single GraphQL gateway can automatically fetch and combine data from multiple services.
### Benefits:
  - Reduces the need for direct API calls between microservices, minimizing network overhead.
  - Centralizes the schema definition, making it easier to manage in complex systems.
  - Enables powerful features like federation and dependency-based querying, reducing boilerplate code.
### Drawbacks:
  - Requires additional setup to establish relationships and manage federated entities.
  - Requires a GraphQL gateway, like Apollo Federation, to handle stitching and routing effectively.
  - Changes to underlying services or schemas may require more careful coordination.
This is ideal for complex microservice architectures, especially where multiple teams work on separate services and entities but require data to be federated in one central API.

In Summary:
Calling a GraphQL API directly is simpler, offers more control, but can add latency and tight coupling between services.
Schema Stitching (Federation) provides a more seamless integration, reduces inter-service calls, but involves more upfront setup and configuration.
Each approach has its place, but schema stitching (or federation) is generally preferred for large-scale applications where several microservices must be seamlessly integrated.
